"Our family and the entire sold out sneak preview audience enjoyed The Guardian. Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher gave convincing performances as the fictional helicopter rescue swimmer characters Ben and Jake. After seeing this movie, you can't help but imagine how difficult it must be to graduate from the USCG helicopter rescue swimmer school and one day take part in real rescues.Even though this is a fictional movie, it delivered rather convincing virtues of team spirit, dedication and bravery exhibited by all the members of the actual U. S. Coast Guard.The special effects used to create the rescue scenes were incredible. You actually felt like you were taking part in a real rescue.I feel the movie could have been made without the Hollywood bar scene when you see the movie, you might agree since the real Coast Guard does not condone such behavior. Very entertaining, very action packed, definitely worth seeing. Thank you, US Coast Guard and the REAL helicopter rescue swimmers, So Others May Live. I'd highly recommend this movie to everyone."
